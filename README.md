# An experimental Webservice for Rusty Raspberry Hourglass

This hobby project is in early state and also experimental, the documentation might be extended or not.

This repo will sooner or later disapear and everything I learned will be build into [rusty-raspberry-hourglass](https://github.com/MarcelBlanck/rusty-raspberry-hourglass)

# Motivation

To control the raspberry hourglass a webservice is the optimal solution. There will be no need for another application and control is device independant.

I choose actix_web because it is an industry proven crate and a great opportunity to learn useful skills.

# Build and run

With a working rust installation just execute cargo run and you are good to go. Then check http://localhost:8080

# API doc

TBD
